# Tournament App

[PWA](https://web.dev/what-are-pwas/) that enables sports tournament attendees to keep up to date with scores and league tables while on site. 

Designed for use at grass roots football (that's a game played with a ball at your feet my American friends.. clue's in the name!) tournaments but adaptable to anything that uses various league and knockout formats.
